# UpNext

Why another todo app? Quite frankly, just because I like to make apps. There are many good todo apps out there, but I wanted to have one of my own.

UpNext is a todo app. Its guiding principles are elegance and simplicity. The todo list is stored in a markdown file in a human-readable way.

## Overview

UpNext allows you to create taks, mark them as complete and delete them. You can also group them by type and reorder the list. All these tasks are stored in a markdown file which can shared across devices to keep your todo list in synchronized.

A sample todo list file looks like this:

```md
# UpNext

## Design related

- [ ] Create the app's logo
- [ ] Choose a color palette

## Development related

- [x] Choose a framework
- [ ] Do some coding ;)

## Other
- [ ] (22/07/2023) Write a blog post about the app
- [ ] Write another blog post about the app (22/07/2023)
```

This snippet higlights the following features:

- Tasks can be separated using markdown headings.
- Dates can be set for tasks.
- Taks can be marked as complete.

## Other features

- Tasks can be reordered by dragging and dropping them.
- Dark mode support (and even custom CSS for geeks).

## Future plans

I would like to add GitHub integration to UpNext. This would allow you to sync your todo list with a GitHub repository and across devices.
