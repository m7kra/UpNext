<p>If you are looking to get started with UpNext, you can check out our <a href="/UpNext/docs/user">user documentation</a>, were you will find a complete overview of the programâ€™s features.</p>

<p>If you want to help out, Iâ€™d love to have someone sharing their knowledge with me. Iâ€™m fairly new to React, Electron and even programming itself. All help and tips are welcome! Take a look at UpNextâ€™s <a href="/UpNext/docs/dev">developer documentation</a>.</p>
